# Car Price Prediction (Simple Linear Regression)

## Overview
A mini project to predict car prices using a simple linear regression model.  
The goal is to understand how a single feature correlates with car price.

## Dataset
- Source: `CarPrice_Assignment.csv`
- Features: Includes several attributes of cars such as horsepower, engine size, etc.
- Target: `price`

## Methods
- Data exploration and correlation analysis
- Simple Linear Regression using the most correlated feature
- Evaluation using R² score and MAE

## Results
The model achieves an R² of **0.804** showing a (strong/moderate/weak) linear relationship between the chosen feature and price.
